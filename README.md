# Code-Quiz
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
I started by doing the HTML file first then the CSS to get an idea of what to worked with.
First idea that I had was to make an object and then from there call all the methods to make it look a little more "clean". Had (and have) struggles with how to start everything with JS. Looked through google to find ideas (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k). I saw a little bit of what he did and one error or I don't actually if it was going to work was to do the questions on HTML but the video he did them at JS. Honestly I that point I was trying to do it at my own but couldn't do it. I didn't know how to start the process.
Then at class with my team we did pseudo-code. It did helped me a lot and tried to implemented at my worked. It did gave me a better understandig. I Still struggled even that I tried to tink of a way. Decided at the end to watch the video.
Follow throught the video it made it look simple. I understood everything he was writing. Still it helped a lot to understand that I need to find a way to come with the ideas or the structure to write what I need to make.
```
I did 10 functions. Still missing the local storage because I got to the part of being stucked with the button to decrease the time and after it runs to 0 it stopped instead of getting to negative numbers.
